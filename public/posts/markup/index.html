<p><span class="newthought">Fundamentally,</span>
 document markup is a way to
encode text. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>This implies that some <em>more complex</em> representation of text is producible from
a <em>simpler</em>,<label for="sidenote-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(1)</label>

 encoded version. It&rsquo;s a simple idea, yet quite effective;
input something short and simple, get something long and complicated. It&rsquo;s
really not hard to see why something that fulfills that promise would be
useful, after all most human technology since simple machines has been used to
turn a little input into a lot of output. In the digital age, however, document
markup mostly refers to / is often conflated with <em>Digital Typesetting</em>, which
is the process of laying out text on a page in a specified way. Most modern
digital typesetting is done in one of two ways:<label for="marginnote-1" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">

<li>WYSIWYG</li>
<li>Markup Languages</li>
</ol>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever used Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or (God forbid) any stock
notepad software that came with your computer, congrats, you&rsquo;ve used a
WYSIWYG editor. WYSIWYG, besides standing for &ldquo;What You See Is What You Get,&rdquo;
is an incredible acronym purely on the basis of
pronunciation.<label for="sidenote-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(2)</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
<span class="sidenote-number">(2)</span>Pronounced &ldquo;whizzy wig&rdquo;, &ldquo;whiz-e-wig&rdquo;, or &ldquo;mostly
bloatware.&rdquo;
</span>
 That said, it is also the most common and most
frustrating way to try to typeset a document that has formatting more advanced
than a Web-1.0 government website.<label for="marginnote-2" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>

</span>
These
editors do ultimately have their place, since their visual nature <em>does</em> make
them a good tool for typesetting simple documents. If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to do
something more complicated, though, you&rsquo;ve likely run into one of their many
limitations.<label for="sidenote-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(3)</label>

 This is
where our second method of typesetting comes in.</p>
<p>Document markup langauges are sometimes defined as &ldquo;nerd shit.&rdquo; Despite this
reputation, document markup languages continue to be used by regular folks and
ultra-poweruser-typesetting nerds alike due to the sheer power they present to
the user. Ever since the advent of the typewriter, writers have been using
document markup to do things like denote headings, emphasize text, and incur my
wrath by adding two spaces after each period in an email. This is known as
<em>semantic markup</em>, where the marks denote the <strong>meaning</strong> of the text. For
example, on typewriters, headings were often <u>underlined</u> to denote their
importance.</p>
<p>The other main type of markup language is <em>presentational</em> markup, where the
marks denote how the text will be <strong>presented</strong>. A common contemporary example
is the common <code>*</code>emphasis<code>*</code><label for="sidenote-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(4)</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-4" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
<span class="sidenote-number">(4)</span>Also notated <code>/</code>emphasis<code>/</code>,
<code>_</code>emphasis<code>_</code>, or &ldquo;emphasis&rdquo; if you somehow still haven&rsquo;t moved on from
typewriters.
</span>
 formatting seen on some social media sites and chat
apps, which denotes that the text should be <em>italicized</em>, or at least that the
reader should imagine it as such. While pesentational and semantic markup are
different things, most markup languages incorporate elements of both.</p>
<p>Alright, now we can finally move on to some examples. I would be more excited,
but I&rsquo;m going to dunk on most of these later, so don&rsquo;t take any of my
explanation of what these markups languages are as an endorsement.</p>

 for the fastest
and most accurate way to represent their thoughts to one another, and have
mostly found people who don&rsquo;t care that much, dude. Eventually, though,
computers were invented, and suddenly everyone cared a <em>lot</em> about speed and
efficacy of written communication. Some of the earliest markup languages were
developed at computing innovation hotspots like Bell Labs and
IBM,<label for="marginnote-3" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>

&ldquo;GNU runoff&rdquo; respectively.
</span>
 These programs were some of the
earliest markup languages that would allow users to do both semantic and
presentational markup in a concise and understandable way. These markup
standards (especially <code>groff</code>) remain some of the most powerful tools for
digital typesetting there are, due to the fine-grained control they grant the
user. Modern usage often involves <em>macro packages</em>,<label for="sidenote-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(6)</label>

</span>

which are condensed control sequences that expand to larger expressions meant
to <strong>make doing more complex things easier on the user</strong>. These programs are
almost exclusively invoked at the command line, which is a bit of a limitation
considering anyone using the command line must, on principle, be a huge
nerd.<label for="marginnote-4" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>

 and Leslie Lamport, the developers behind the <code>$\TeX$</code>
language and its <code>$\LaTeX$</code> macro package respectively. <code>$\TeX$</code> is an
incredibly powerful typesetting language, though much like <code>roff</code>, it&rsquo;s far too
verbose. Much more frequently used is <code>$\LaTeX$</code>, a macro package which
abstracts a lot of that complexity while retaining that fine-grained control
that makes a markup language so powerful. <code>$\LaTeX$</code> is famous for its
beautiful and elegant equations, and since its initial development in 1985 has
remained the gold standard for academic writing and math typesetting. Outside
of academic contexts, however, the syntax of <code>$\TeX$</code>-based documents can be
cumbersome and <em>still</em> overly verbose, especially for things like
documentation, blogging, or sending memos to your co-workers that nobody will
ever read.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Markdown is agreed upon</span>
 as a standard in the
same way early scientists agreed a meter is roughly <em>this</em> big. Still, it has
become one of the most ubiquitous forms of document markup in the modern
digital landscape, used by practically everyone and their
octocat.<label for="sidenote-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(7)</label>

</span>

Markdown is what Wikipedia calls a &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; markup language, and it shows
in its syntax. At its core, markdown is really just prose decorated with some
syntax for headings, different text styles, and some other things like links
and lists. Built from the ground-up to convert well to HTML, markdown lends
itself well to use cases like online documentation and
blogging,<label for="marginnote-6" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-6" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
Much to my chagrin, this page is formatted in
markdown.
</span>
 both of which benefit massively from its light
syntax. It even <del>forces</del> lets you embed HTML. Awesomeâ€¦</p>
<p>For those more focused on the physical and outisde the online, AsciiDoc is
another primary choice that converts well to PDF, the chosen file format for
most markup languages&rsquo; exports. Boasting a similarly lightweight syntax,
AsciiDoc also includes a few more tools for things like math, callout
blocks,<label for="sidenote-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(8)</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-8" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
<span class="sidenote-number">(8)</span>Also called &ldquo;admonitions&rdquo; or sometimes
&ldquo;condescending&rdquo;
</span>

and document metadata.<label for="marginnote-7" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-7" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
&ldquo;But markdown has support fo-&rdquo; NOPE. Read
on, find out.
</span>
 AsciiDoc is similarly lightweight, and focuses
on being easy to write using simple ASCII characters, making it ideal for doing
things like taking quick notes for later cleaning and export, or formatting
those aforementioned perpetually unread memos.</p>
<p>One of the great benefits of these newer, lighter-weight standards is their
lack of independence on environment. You can write markdown and AsciiDoc in
almost any editor on almost any platform, whereas something like <code>groff</code> is
tough to get working on a non-unix system, and <code>$\LaTeX$</code> requires boatloads of
tooling to make it bearable to write. These key characteristics of ease of use
and compatability make these languages shine in a modern context, especially
when you ignore how completely worthless they are.<label for="marginnote-8" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>

Out of all of
them, though, markdown is definitely the worst.

aforementioned academic standard <code>$\LaTeX$</code>, we get syntax like this:</p>

Despite all the weirdness of Luke Smith, I am glad he

 That doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not
blinded by how many lines this example takes up. In its origins as an early
text processing tool, <code>groff</code> chose to make each new command happen at the
start of a line and prefixed with a period, which is actually a really good
choice for people who want carpal tunnel in their right hand. Needless to say,
it&rsquo;s archaic and doesn&rsquo;t see much use anymore.<label for="sidenote-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(11)</label>

 like to talk
about <em>flavors</em> of markdown like it&rsquo;s some sort of buffet. There&rsquo;s <em>pandoc</em>
flavored markdown, <em>github</em> flavored markdown, hell, there&rsquo;s even <em>R markdown</em>,
which runs <code>R</code> code on your markdown file to statistically analyze how much
time you&rsquo;ve wasted trying to figure out why your paragraph is
monospaced.<label for="marginnote-14" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>

<span class="marginnote">
Not to mention that compiling your document takes
absolute <em>ages</em> with R markdown.
</span>
 All of these different
standards have different ways of doing things. Some support using <code>+</code> or <code>*</code>
for bullet lists, some don&rsquo;t. Some support code blocks with language syntax
highlighting, some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t be such a problem if markdown wasn&rsquo;t the bona fide standard for
modern document markup in the software world,<label for="marginnote-15" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-15" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
I consider GitHub
a gateway to markdown addiction, and even then most READMEs I&rsquo;ve seen contain a
significant amount of HTML.
</span>
 and even outside of it in the
blogging sphere. The reach of markdown is so vast that people have tacitly
accepted these horrors for themselves, unaware of the sins they commit each
time they start an italic delimiter with a &lsquo;*&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This pattern is perpetuated through nearly all of the standards I&rsquo;ve come
across in my search for the perfect markup language. I use markup languages
mostly for notetaking and formatting handouts,<label for="marginnote-16" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-16" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
I consider these
to be relatively common use cases, given things like the (in)famous <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/">castel.dev
post</a> and the existence of tools like
vimwiki.
</span>
 which basically means I have to either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a billion macros in my editor to use something like <code>$\LaTeX$</code> or
<code>groff</code>, or</li>
<li>Settle for something like markdown or AsciiDoc that isn&rsquo;t quite powerful
enough,</li>
</ol>
<p>and that just isn&rsquo;t acceptable to me.</p>
<h2 id="ecosystem">
Ecosystem
<a href="#ecosystem" class="heading-anchor">#</a>
</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">A good markup language</span>
 has good tooling for
using it. Whether it&rsquo;s turning the markup into a finished format or importing
macros made by other users, a good ecosystem is a big part of what makes a
markup language easy to use.</p>
<p><code>groff</code>&rsquo;s ecosystem is archaic/nonexistent.<label for="marginnote-17" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-17" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
Of all of these, I
think <code>groff</code> actually does it best with its <code>UNIX</code>-y use style, but the
documentation is so <em>scattered</em> and <em>in man pages</em> that it negates that
entirely.
</span>
 Modern <code>$\LaTeX$</code> opts to use about a billion
packages distributed in about a dozen ways to address the needs of users. I&rsquo;ve
seen many a <code>$\LaTeX$</code> document where the package imports take up nearly as
much space as the actual document content. AsciiDoc&rsquo;s ecosystem is pretty good,
but severly lacking in extensibility. Markdown&rsquo;s ecosystem is not just bad,
it&rsquo;s <em>everywhere</em>.<label for="marginnote-18" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-18" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
I consider markdown to be the asbestos of the
markup langauge world. It&rsquo;s super harmful and also <em>in
everything</em>.
</span>
 Every editor instance has a different set of
things you can use with it, and the web tech rendering your markdown is usually
what determines what you can/can&rsquo;t use. It shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard to create a
good ecosystem for a markup language. Just <em>having</em> an official way to use it
is even a high bar for modern markup languages. Having one that also doesn&rsquo;t
force the user to use it is even rarer.</p>
<p>Possibly the most frustrating aspect of modern markup languages is their severe
lack of use. These things should be ubiquitous like WYSIWYG. People shouldn&rsquo;t
default to taking notes in Google Docs, and yet here we are. I know not of a
markup language with an ecosystem good enough and a syntax simple enough for
ordinary people to just get on board and use it.<label for="sidenote-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(14)</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-14" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
<span class="sidenote-number">(14)</span>There used to be
one, but that one was called <em>shorthand</em> and requires
handwriting.

 The power of markup is lost on the general
population because of insidious flaws in our standards.</p>
<h2 id="philosphy">
Philosphy
<a href="#philosphy" class="heading-anchor">#</a>
</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Where does that</span>
 leave us? The philosophy of
most markup languages is either that &ldquo;users should be able to get the maximum
output from minimum markup&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo; Even most of what we&rsquo;ve been talking
about misses the real point; formatting documents into digital formats is
generally <em>difficult</em>, and markup languages are meant to make it
<em>easy</em>.<label for="marginnote-19" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-19" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
Remember that first sidenote? Yeah. We&rsquo;re
back.
</span>
 Even in the discussion of syntax earlier, you, the
reader, <em>implicitly</em> had to learn what the syntax <em>was</em> and what it <em>meant</em> for
any of that conversation to be relevant and comprehensible.</p>
<p>The flaws in modern markup philosophy become even more obvious when we look at
what these languages are actually <em>for</em>. Markdown is really <em>for</em> writing HTML
faster, which it does super effectively by making you write HTML anyway.
<code>$\LaTeX$</code> is really <em>for</em> extremely use-case specific scientific writing, and
while it has flaws, it does that reasonably well. AsciiDoc is <em>for</em>
writing low stakes technical content,<label for="sidenote-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(15)</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-15" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
<span class="sidenote-number">(15)</span><a href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/">Its
website</a> even says as much.
</span>
 and
excels at that.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with modern markup is that <strong>all of these languages are
pitched as whole solutions for every circumstance by people who don&rsquo;t know
better</strong>.<label for="marginnote-20" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-20" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
Yes, I&rsquo;ve tried org mode, vimwiki, neorg, and dozens
of other formats/methods. I dislike all of them.
</span>
 These
languages are tools, and each has their use case, but there is no sonic
screwdriver, there is no Batman&rsquo;s belt, and there is no God, only the winding
threads of the cosmos pulling us closer and closer to writing HTML by hand.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; the problems with syntax and ecosystem we&rsquo;ve discussed are
<em>very</em> real and <em>very</em> frustrating for people like me who can&rsquo;t handwrite
things.<label for="marginnote-21" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-21" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
Curse you, wrist issues and sensitivity to the texture
of paper!
</span>
 The problem plaguing modern markup that saddens me
most, though, is that of the missing middle. There is next to nothing in the
gap between something like Markdown and something like <code>$\LaTeX$</code>, between the
usability of the lightweight and the power of the academic.</p>
<h1 id="iii-what-now">

about them.<label for="sidenote-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(16)</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-16" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
<span class="sidenote-number">(16)</span>There&rsquo;s an excellent up-and-coming language called
<a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a> that addresses a lot of what I&rsquo;ve talked about,
though it&rsquo;s still not perfect.
</span>
 There is still, however, a long
road ahead between where we are and getting to the platonic form of the perfect
markup language.</p>
<p>The thing that would help most right now is if more people really <em>understood</em>
this problem. To do that, though, one must actually <em>use</em> a markup language. I
highly encourage anyone who has read this far to pick up a markup langauge,
even if it&rsquo;s markdown.<label for="marginnote-22" class="margin-toggle marginnote-ind">ðŸ“Ž</label>
